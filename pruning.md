**In Progress**

The current workflow for pruning and intersectect as many SNPs associated with both metabolites and Trait of interest

1) Use swiss to prune the metabolite dataset to representative SNP values. 
2) Use swiss to find all snps the are in LD with those metabolit representative SNPs
3) Intersect the CAD dataset w/ metabolite dataset
