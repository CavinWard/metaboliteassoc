**In Progress**

The current workflow for prunng and intersectect as many SNPs associated with both metabolites and Trait of interest

1) Use swiss to prune the dataset to representative SNP values. 
2) Use swiss to find all snps the are in LD with those representative SNPs
3) Intersect the CAD dataset w/ metabolite dataset
